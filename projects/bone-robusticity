The goal of this project was to measure surface curvature values of 3D meshes. They were meshes of scanned human bones. Prior to this, measurement of "robusticity" were made by looking at the bone and deciding a rough value between 1-5. This meant the numbers were not particularly accurate, and did not have much analytical merit. 
I achieved a system for analyzing the surface curvature by using open source software for analyzing 3D triangular meshes, and combining this output with some Python code that gave a statistical analysis of the data.
