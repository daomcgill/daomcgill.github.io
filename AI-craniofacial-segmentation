Segmentation is the process of separating medical scans into regions--called segments--to isolate specific areas of interest. Traditionally, it is a tedious task that takes radiologists many hours before arriving upon a completed segmentation. Recent advances of Artificial Intelligence in the field of computer vision have allowed for the creation of automated segmentation models. For this project, I used open source software:
- Monailabel
- Slicer3D

The goal of this project is create a model for the segmentation of head CT scans, to allow for a rendered model of the skin. Manually, it is a painstaking task that can take up to hours for each scan. By using training data models are now being generated in under a minute. Some of the issues I have ran into to are the difficulty of acquiring patient data without compromising their privacy rights, setting up the model to work in an efficient manner and the manual segmentation process which takes an excessive amount of time. 
The future goal of this project is to map the rendered models to live facial tracking technology (Google MediaPipe), for the potential advancing into surgical use in the future. Medical technology is very expensive, and unaffordable for many medical facilities, especially those in third world countries. I believe that the future of medical technology can be on a better path if open source research is given an opportunity to progress.
This project is still being worked on, and there is not yet a GitHub repository.
