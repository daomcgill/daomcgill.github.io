# Growing Pains
When I first started programming, I was introduced to the concept of coding standards. At the time they seemed like an unnecessary hurdle. In school, we’re taught to write essays with proper English, but writing code isn’t like crafting an essay; it's a whole different beast. While the importance of clear code is undeniable, the attention to detail that coding standards demanded were tedious.

## Discovering the Magic of ESLint
Enter ESLint and its integration with IntelliJ. To say it was a game-changer would be an understatement. After investing hours into crafting a piece of software, manually rereading every line to ensure it aligns with some predetermined standards feels as taxing as re-reading a long essay hunting for minor grammatical errors. However, ESLint transformed this tedious task into something far more bearable.

Think about the spell check functionality we often use when writing documents. It's a tool that highlights our errors, allowing us to correct them without combing through each line manually. Now, imagine a tool even more potent for code. ESLint does exactly that. Given the complex nature of code compared to natural language, the advantage of such a tool is magnified.

## Parallels Between Writing and Coding
It took me years to master the nuances of the English language. Countless essays, reports, and articles were written to develop those skills. Given the investment in learning to communicate effectively in English, it is only natural to have to put the same time into 'speaking' fluently in the language of machines. If I'm expecting my audience to understand my English writing, shouldn't I expect people to understand my code with the same clarity? 

## Efficiency and Aesthetics
With ESLint, not only is it easier to spot errors, but the entire process becomes far more efficient. A single click identifies errors, highlighting the exact location that is wrong. The benefits are not just functional; it looks pretty too. Post-ESLint, my code transformed from a haphazard collection of lines to a neatly formatted, visually pleasing structure.

## Conclusion
Coding standards, while initially annoying to master, play a huge role in creating readable code. With tools like ESLint, following these standards becomes less of a chore and more of an automated process, ensuring that the code we write not only functions optimally but also looks nice and easy to understand.
