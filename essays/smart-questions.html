<p><a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to ask questions the smart way</a> is a guide on how to ask high quality questions, to get high quality answers. Here is a short summary of the process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Try to find the answer in existing resources (forums, google, manuals, etc.). Keeping a log of what has been learned will make it easier to form a question later.</li>
  <li>If an answer cannot be found, THEN start considering where the best place to ask the question is. This will likely be a forum dedicated to related topics.</li>
  <li>Use a useful subject header. The guide recommends the format “object – deviation.” People should know what the question is going to be about by reading just the subject line.</li>
  <li>When writing the question, state what has already been tried (hence the log in step 1). Clearly state the issue and the goal.</li>
</ol>

<p>That is the basic process, but the guide is an entertaining read that has a lot more pointers, so check it out in the link above.</p>

<h2 id="an-example-of-a-smart-question">An Example of a Smart Question</h2>

<p>Here is a question from Stack Overflow about speed of processing a sorted vs unsorted array: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array">Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?</a>. It may seem like a simple question, but it has been viewed 1.8 million times, and has 25 in-depth expert answers.</p>

<h2 id="and-an-example-of-a-bad-question">And An Example of a Bad Question</h2>

<p>This question, on the other hand, has 0 upvotes and one rather confused answer: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75479789/vue-slider-bar-has-a-bug">Vue slider bar has a bug</a>.</p>

<p><img width="800px" src="../img/SO-ss-3.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="what-made-this-a-bad-question">What made this a bad question:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The name is not useful, and goes against the advice of How to ask questions the smart way by stating that a program has a bug.</li>
  <li>A vague description of the issue followed by “it stops working and I’m so confused.”</li>
  <li>“Please can you guys help me?” Unsure what they are asking for help about, what they have done to try to fix it, and what the “bug” is.</li>
</ul>
