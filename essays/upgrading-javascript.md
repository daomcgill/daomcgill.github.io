# Upgrading to JavaScript
Dao McGill

**The first programming language I ever learned was Java.** I'm not sure if it was because everything about Computer Science was completely new to me, but I had a lot of difficulty getting even the simplest code to work the way I wanted it to. I often forgot the syntax and constantly omitted semicolons and brackets. A few years—and many new programming languages—have passed since then, and I am now learning JavaScript. I am amazed by how much more naturally it comes to me and how much sense everything makes.

### Features That Make JavaScript Stand Out

- **Heterogeneous collections**: Allow for multiple data types in the same array.
- **First-class functions**: Functions can be used like variables, making it massively more straightforward to work with. It really just makes sense.
- **Prototype inheritance**: Makes objects simpler to create and manipulate.
- **Weakly Typed**: The fact that JavaScript is weakly typed makes it very forgiving to work with. There is flexibility in the way types are used, making it possible for me to write simple code faster and with less planning. The downside is that there is more potential for errors to occur later.
- **Readability**: JavaScript is very readable. There is no need to pore over every line to understand what is going on, unlike in, for example, C.

### JavaScript and WODs

I think JavaScript is an optimal language for use in WODs since they are timed and high-pressure. I was a little intimidated by the WODs at first, but they have actually proven to be a good way to learn to write code under pressure. I usually spend a long time thinking about what I will write before I actually start, but the WODs have shown me that sometimes this is not as necessary as I once thought.
