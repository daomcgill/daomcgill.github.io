# Why Software Engineering

I have often been asked why I choose to study Computer Science. My interest in Software Engineering is in the possibility of creating  digital solutions that tackle real-world challenges. Two distinct fields that capture my interest: fintech and biomedical technology.

## Fintech

Fintech, with its mix of financial expertise and technological sophistication, holds immense potential for reshaping how we manage and interact with our finances. The prospect of creating software solutions that provide financial solutions and security intrigues me. In todayâ€™s world technology is everywhere, and large financial institutions are at the same time operating huge technology factions.

## Biomedical Technology

My interest in biomedical technology stems from the profound impact that technology can have on healthcare. My interest started when I began interning and doing research with the UH medical school. The idea that research and development of technology can be used in the real world to aid in healthcare is quite exciting to me. The potential to develop new methods and tools is really just endless. I am especially enthusiastic about open source medical software that can be made available to anyone. It may seem like an impossible idea, but more and more medical software is being shared in a way that is accessible to anyone regardless of who are where in the world they may be.

## In Conclusion: Why?

I aspire to make meaningful contributions to the fields of fintech and biomedical technology.
